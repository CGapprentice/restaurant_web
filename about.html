        <h1>Our Story</h1>

        <div class="about-content">
            <div class="about-text">
                <p>Welcome to Dougies, where the vibrant flavors of Jamaica come alive in every dish. Founded in 2015, our restaurant was born from a passion to share authentic Jamaican cuisine with our community.</p>

                <p>Our founder, Douglas "Dougie" Williams, grew up in Kingston, Jamaica, learning the art of Caribbean cooking from his grandmother. Her recipes, passed down through generations, form the heart of our menu. When Dougie moved to the United States, he brought these cherished family recipes with him, along with a dream to introduce others to the rich culinary traditions of his homeland.</p>

                <p>At Dougies, we pride ourselves on using traditional cooking methods and authentic ingredients. Our jerk seasoning is made fresh daily using a secret blend of scotch bonnet peppers, allspice, and herbs. Every pot of rice and peas is cooked with coconut milk and the perfect balance of spices. Our oxtail is slow-braised for hours until it falls off the bone.</p>

                <p>More than just a restaurant, Dougies is a place where families gather, friends celebrate, and everyone is welcomed like family. We believe that food is meant to be shared, and every meal is an opportunity to create memories.</p>

                <p>Come taste the island. Come taste tradition. Come taste Dougies.</p>
